Concepts from other creators:

- A ball bouncing but when the time runs out it gets frozen.
- A ball getting faster every bounce but it can bounce on its tail.
- 2 blocks colliding but every bounce they go 2% faster
- Runaway by Kanye West. Ball bounces vertically and when the melody starts it bounces faster and in all directions.
- When the bounces run out the square freezes and spawns a new one but every time it increases the bounces.
- When the square turns red a new one spawns
- A triangle that gets smaller and faster every bounce
- After 3 bounces the ball freezes and spawns a new one
- A ball bouncing but it speeds up every bounce in a polygon shape
- Every bounce the ball gets smaller and faster and a new line is added
- After 5 bounces the ball is frozen and a new one spawns
- When the counter hits 0 the ball is frozen and a new one spawns
